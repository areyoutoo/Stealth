{"name":"Stealth","tagline":"A quick and dirty Unity3D game made in three hours for the #1G3H game jam.","body":"Built players\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* [Windows](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27627047/Stealth.zip)\r\n* [Linux](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27627047/Stealthnix.zip)\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe game is a basic platformer. You are a thief (or maybe a ninja?) sneaking past guards to collect gold pieces.\r\n\r\nControls are as follows:\r\n\r\n* WASD keys move\r\n* SPACE jumps (hold to jump higher)\r\n* You can jump up through platforms (or fall down through them, by pressing S)\r\n* You can cling to walls\r\n\r\nPressing Escape will take you back out to the menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe game should work just fine on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\r\n\r\nThere are no control bindings for mobile devices.\r\n","google":"UA-41366415-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
