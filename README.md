Stealth
=======

Quick and dirty video game made in three hours for #1G3H


Instructions
------------

The game is a basic platformer. You are a thief (or maybe a ninja?) sneaking past guards to collect gold pieces.

Controls are as follows:

* WASD keys move
* SPACE jumps (hold to jump higher)
* You can jump up through platforms (or fall down through them, by pressing S)
* You can cling to walls

Pressing Escape will take you back out to the menu.


Notes
-----

The game should work just fine on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

There are no control bindings for mobile devices.
